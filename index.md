# Hello!

My name is George Larionov, welcome to my site!



### About Me:
I was born in Moscow, Russia, moving here at the ripe age of four years old. Currently, I am a junior at UMASS Amherst, studying Computer Science and having a lot of fun.

I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, ice climbing, and playing rugby. I also enjoy learning new programming languages, API's, and generally hacking and learning new things.
